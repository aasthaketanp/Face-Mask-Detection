## Introduction
Amidst the global health challenges, face masks have become an indispensable protective measure. This repository houses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to efficiently detect whether an individual is wearing a face mask, not wearing one, or is wearing it incorrectly.

## Features
*- Highly Accurate:* Boasts a remarkable detection accuracy rate of up to 98%.  
*- Dual Optimizer Analysis:* Incorporates experimentation with both ADAM and RMSProp optimizers to ensure peak performance.  
*- Real-time Video Processing:* Capable of analyzing video feeds, converting up to 300 frames into actionable insights and even into audio output.  
*- Audio Feedback Mechanism:* Goes beyond visual detection, offering the capability to inform users via audio feedback.

## Results
- Utilizing the ADAM optimizer, our model showcased nearly identical training and validation accuracies, exemplifying its robust performance.  
- The RMSProp optimizer exhibited an even superior generalization prowess.  
- The potential application for this model extends to video surveillance systems, promising an augmented layer of safety in public spaces.

## Conclusion & Future Work
Wearing face masks is still crucial in health setups and crowded areas. While the spread of COVID-19 has reduced, the lessons learned emphasize the need for proactive solutions for potential future health crises. This system aims to encourage mask-wearing by automating detection. Future improvements could see the integration of a Bag-of-features model for better representation. There is also a need to address potential issues, like the model misinterpreting a hand covering the mouth as a mask.
